In the next posts I will be covering the building process of a Project North Star headset, the open-source augmented reality headset from Leap Motion. I am going to build the simplified optics version (3.1) with mount for the Intel T265 Realsense camera in order to give the headset 6 DOF, although I will be covering this more extensively in the 3D printing post. I have printed the 3D parts at home and I have ordered the mechanical parts, as well as the electronics and optics from [smart prototyping](https://www.smart-prototyping.com/AR-VR-MR-XR). 

If you are interested in the project and want to know more, you **really** should join the [discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/ATPm9Fy).

The idea is to divide the process in the following posts:

+ 3D printed pieces.
+ Building process.
+ Manual calibration.
+ Automatic calibration.
+ Software.
