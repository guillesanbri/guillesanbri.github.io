### Me

Hey! I'm Guillermo, a research engineer focused on deep learning and computer vision, especially when they are applied to real-world systems. My main interests are efficient inference, self-supervised learning, edge deployment, robotics, environmental sensing, and a long etcetera. I like working on hard problems, pushing boundaries a little further, and learning along the way.

Tech aside (tricky) I'm into [long-distance running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/135079462) and classical art.

### Background

I studied Industrial Electronics and Automation Engineering, where I focused on robotics and computer vision, then followed it up with a Master's in Computer Science with a focus on deep learning.

Recently, I was a Founding Machine Learning Engineer at [Unify.ai](https://unify.ai/) (YC-backed), where we built a [framework-agnostic graph compiler for tensor-based code](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/80704), worked on efficient inference, and developed infrastructure for LLMs (routing, APIs, deployment, observability). Before that, I worked on image segmentation and object detection models for medical robotics.

Right now I‚Äôm spending some time exploring new ideas, learning from the latest research, and looking for the next adventure!
