### The page

This page aims to collect some of my personal projects, mainly about computer vision, deep learning, virtual and augmented reality, programming and some other things. My objective is to provide information about procedures and concepts in order to give something back to the internet in exchange for everything it has offered me. 

I will be posting here in a non-perfect English.

### Me

My name is Guillermo, I am a 22 years old Industrial Electronics and Automation Engineer currently studying for a Computer Science Master's degree at Valladolidâ€™s University in Spain while working as a research fellow doing data analysis and computer vision stuff.
