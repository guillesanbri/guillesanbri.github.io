### The website

This page is a collection of my personal projects and thoughts, primarily focused on computer vision, deep learning, virtual and augmented reality, programming, and related stuff. I can't promise to stick to these all the time but the main goals are to document things for my future self and to share something useful with the internet. Enjoy!

### Me

I'm Guillermo. I studied Industrial Electronics and Automation Engineering and then diverted into a Master's in Computer Science, focusing on Computer Vision and Deep Learning. Now, I work as a Research ML Engineer at [Unify](https://unify.ai/) building infra for LLMs.
