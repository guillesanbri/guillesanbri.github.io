### The website

This page hopefully collects some of my personal projects/thoughts, mainly about computer vision, deep learning, virtual and augmented reality, programming and similar stuff, can't promise anything. The main goals are documenting stuff for my future self and giving something back to the internet in exchange for everything it has offered me. Enjoy!

### Me

My name is Guillermo, I studied Industrial Electronics and Automation Engineering and then diverted into a Computer Science Master's degree focused on Computer Vision and Deep Learning. I am currently working as a Research ML Engineer at [Unify](https://unify.ai/) building bridges between all ML and DL infrastructure.
