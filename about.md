### Me

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/about.jpg" alt="A picture of me, you are not missing a lot"/>

My name is Guillermo, I studied Industrial Electronics and Automation Engineering and then diverted into a Computer Science Master's degree focused on Computer Vision and Deep Learning in general. I am currently working as a Research ML Engineer at [Unify](https://unify.ai/) building bridges between all ML and DL infrastructure ðŸš€

### The page

This page aims to collect some of my personal projects/thoughts, mainly about computer vision, deep learning, virtual and augmented reality, programming and some other things. The main objective is to provide insights about procedures and concepts in order to give something back to the internet in exchange for everything it has offered and keeps offering me. 

Posts here will be written in non-perfect English.
