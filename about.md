### The page

This page aims to collect some of my personal projects, mainly about virtual and augmented reality, programming and some other things. My objective is to provide information about procedures and concepts in order to give something back to the internet in exchange for everything it has offered me. 

I will be posting here in a non-perfect English.

### Me

My name is Guillermo, I am a 21 years old student about to finish a degree in Industrial Electronics and Automation Engineering at Valladolidâ€™s University in Spain.
